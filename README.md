## Problem Statement

In disaster response scenarios, efficient allocation and distribution of essential supplies such as food, water, and medicines to flood-affected areas are crucial for mitigating human suffering and facilitating recovery efforts. Given a map of flooded areas within the city of Chennai, marked as vertices in a graph, and equipped with an autonomous battery-operated micro aquatic boat capable of detecting flooded regions and responding to distress signals, the challenge is to devise an optimal path that covers all affected areas while minimizing energy consumption and travel time.

The primary objective of this research is to develop a path planning algorithm tailored for autonomous relief operations in flood-stricken regions. The algorithm must ensure that the autonomous boat traverses each road (edge in the graph) exactly once, covering all flooded areas to fulfill the supply needs of the affected population. Additionally, the algorithm should optimize the path to minimize the total distance traveled and maximize resource delivery efficiency, considering the limited battery capacity of the autonomous boat.

This research addresses the critical need for efficient and effective resource allocation in disaster response efforts by providing a novel approach to path planning in flooded areas. By optimizing the route taken by the autonomous boat, the proposed algorithm aims to enhance the speed and efficacy of relief operations, ultimately aiding in the timely delivery of essential supplies to those in need and minimizing the impact of natural disasters on affected communities.
